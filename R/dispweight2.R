### Veganified version of Eduard Sz√∂cs's dispweight. This version
### reuses other vegan utilities as much as possible and follows vegan
### conventions. Basically, we primarily want to get transformed data
### with information on transformation. Only basically needed
### information are the overdispersion coefficients (D) and p-values;
### the weights can be found from these.
